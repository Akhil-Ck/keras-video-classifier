# keras-video-classifier-web-api

Keras implementation of video classifiers serving as web

The training data is [UCF101 - Action Recognition Data Set](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php)

The opencv-python is used to extract frames from the videos.

# Deep Learning Models

The following deep learning models have been implemented and studied:

* VGG16+LSTM: this approach uses VGG16 to extract features from individual frame of the video, the sequence of frame features are then taken into LSTM recurrent networks for classifier.

    * predictor: video_classifier_web/vgg16_lstm_predict.py
